To run the program, open index.html.
Right now, it only works on internet explorer and (75% sure) Safari.
Use the arrow keys to move around the world and try to dodge the buildings. Have fun!

We implemented lighting only on the plane.
There is also sound. This can be toggled on the menu that appears when you crash.

Advanced Topics:
Collision detection
Bump mapping on the floor

We had some wierd effects when we ran this on a mac with retina display on safari. The floor flickered when we implemented bump mapping and the plane had a diamond-like effect.

It works well on windows with internet explorer.
